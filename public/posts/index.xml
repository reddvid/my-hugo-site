      <description>Started coding using VB.Net and Forms for our final year thesis (which programming was NOT a major). Then while gearing up for board exams, learnt to code and design for Windows Phone 7.5/7.8/8 using XAML, C# &amp;amp; Silverlight.
Then came Windows 8.1 and WP8.1 on the Univeral App Shared codes, but didn&amp;rsquo;t dive that deep because of some weird Windows 8.1 windowing and such.
Finally W10 and UWP, still slowly learning and managed to improve my coding skills.</description>
