Hi! I am David. I am an electronics engineer and an app developer.

I currently work as an IT admin at CNN Philippines (seconded by Radio Philippines Network).

On off days, I develop desktop and mobile applications using XAML/C# and Flutter/Dart stacks, respectively. I also know a little bit of bare HTML/CSS/JS.

## Background

I started coding in college for our project study, RFID Gate System. We used Forms and VB.Net for the software and C++ for the Arduino controller. I then got into Windows Phone App development and learned C#, XAML, and Git. The first apps I developed were mostly for personal-use until I registered and submitted one to the Windows Phone Store.

Then I developed apps that helped me simplify daily tasks, from monitoring, reporting statistical data, to automating web interactions. What started as a hobby became a small source of income.

## Bio

I lived and grew up until 21 in a small town in Pangasinan and moved to Metro Manila to venture for a living.

I can speak Filipino (Tagalog) and English (spoken: 8, written: 9). I can also speak in my local language Pangasinan.

I graduated and passed the Electronics Engineering board exams on 2013.
