As you might have noticed, I haven't blogged in more than a month (since April 27th). So here are some highlights and what has happened:

## Outing before May

First week I got to join an outing to a private pool to unwind. The travel is quite a pain since it was on a Friday night. It was a simple company get-together but so glad I came.

## Election Season

We are yet again elect the two of the highest positions of the government and I got a week off from work (too bad they won't let me have a laptop - so I could at least check back when needed). I got to spend my mom's 50th birthday (again on a location with a pool) where I emcee'd for a bit.

Going home also means I got to eat better and healthier. So sad I spent most inside since it was extremely hot on our place - so I got to continue reading some books.

## Reading Books

As said on a [previous blog post](/new-in-2022/), I finished Atomic Habits and finished another two books: Outliers and Essentialism. Reading this three books made me make some changes in my life especially with Essentialism which particularly affected my focus - in work, play, and life.

I began journaling daily activities, avoid doing "unessential" things, and take and "think" things slow.

My reading list as of now:

- The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck
- Everything is F\*cked
- Zero to One
- Designing for Work

My reading is on and off to "accommodate" other things like taking short online courses on Udemy, doing some coding courses, and of course doing essential work.

## Plans?

I'll go ahead and say I might not be posting again anytime soon (or maybe if motivation comes) since I am keeping my self busy with work, and "essential" activities. I also stopped playing video games which is sad but it also means I get to read books or code.

### Mastering dotnet

Took so long but I think I really get to at least master .NET and C#.

### Manage Myself

Just think about it yourself.

### Tie the Knot

Getting closer to October for a new chapter.

That's it for me, May went by so fast and it's now June, I'm getting older in a few days.
