I recently bought an Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 which I should've made long ago. It's an expensive piece of a great tech which I never thought I needed.

I hesitated to get one before because of the price but until I knew that the deck can be used just fine without the "unchangeable" height stand. And also, the time-save it can bring definitely helps in daily tasks.

## Unboxing, where?

Unfortunately, I never got to take a video or even photos of the unboxing. The box contains the device, the detachable USB-C cable, and the stand. Sadly, it does not include a free faceplate to interchange the default black plain plate.

## Setting Up

The device requires the [Stream Deck application](https://www.elgato.com/en/downloads) to actually setup what actions the buttons will do.

There are also lots of useful community-made plugins inside the Stream Deck's Store that you will find very useful.

Setting the device is technically easy but I felt that some icon designs (the ones I needed) are very basic and were not standard.

So I try to make my own minimal but on-context (for me) icons.

## Making Custom Icons

After reading Elgato's [Style Guide Documentation](https://developer.elgato.com/documentation/stream-deck/sdk/style-guide/#asset-sizes-and-colors) for making Stream Deck Icons, I decided to start doing my key icons.

| Icon     | Size     | @2x        |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Key Icon | 72x72 px | 144x144 px |

Thankfully, I use [Figma](figma.com) for wireframing/designing graphics so it is the best tool to create these icons. Plus, it has an export button that upscale the design @2x.

### Previews

Here are some of the icons in action (Stream Deck mockup).

The icons are available in my Github repo: [mnml-strmdck-icns](https://github.com/reddvid/mnml-strmdck-icns)

I will soon share the Figma file.

### Tools and Resources

Big thanks for the free & open tools and resources I used:

- Figma (and it's Community)
- PowerToys
- Wikimedia Commons
- SVG Export Chrome Extension
- Character Map UWP
- Bootstrap Icons
- Coffee

## Tips and Tricks

There are a lot of things the Stream Deck can do, like me, I scour the internet (mostly YouTube) for any tips and tricks.
