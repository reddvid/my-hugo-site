In case you missed it, Microsoft acquired a web-based video editing app known as [Clipchamp](clipchamp.com) back in Q4 2021. And after they finally put the app into Windows to become a slightly better editing tool (also on Xbox?), but all it gave to users are disappointment because of features locked behind [overpriced subscription](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsofts-clipchamp-video-editing-tools-are-underbaked).

## Who Exports at 480p? Give us 1080p, Please!

Yes, who does? And surprisingly, Clichamp offers free users to ONLY export their video projects into 480p.

### Good News!

What a shame, but as of this writing I got an email from Clipchamp that 1080p exports is now available for everyone.

1080p exports is now the base resolution for all tiers of plans:

Though I am yet to use this app, I've read online that it's somehow intuitive by the online-based resources: templates, music & SFX, stock images, graphics, filters, effects, etc. that are suitable for quick and effortless video creations.

Check the app online at [**app.clipchamp.com**](app.clipchamp.com) or download from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P1J8S7CCWWT).
