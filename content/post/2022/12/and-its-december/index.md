How many times have I apologized for not posting on my blog? üòÖ

Let‚Äôs just recap, shall we?

## I Got Married

Yes, people still marry despite the hardships in this f-ing country, and I am one of them last October. We both felt it is time after 8 years of being together.

The prior months were not all wedding-preparations as I read and took some online courses and learning programs - more about [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), and leadership/project management.

## Learning In-Depth Flutter

The infamous Angela Yu‚Äôs Flutter bootcamp course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) has been sitting on my learning for a few months and I finally decided to take it on since I really really have to update and improve my Flutter/Dart coding - and to update some apps.

I faced some problems with the course since it was outdated to the current Flutter version but it all went good, thanks for the updated documentation of Flutter and [pub.dev](http://pub.dev) packages.

I learned DRY (**d**on‚Äôt **r**epeat **y**ourself) - again - especially with Flutter‚Äôs all code UI. So, learning to convert most reusable Widgets to ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù is fun.

I also learned a few techniques and best practices.

## Updating RPN Radio App

After my ‚Äúwedding‚Äù break from the office, I came back with the motivation to update this app. Before updating, there was a ‚Äúdowngrade‚Äù with the app logic which disabled viewing stations‚Äô _live_ and _offline_ status.

And the app needed a UI/UX refresh - well at least for the player part.

The app is now available to download for free on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rpnradio.radiov1&hl=en&gl=US) and [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rpn-radio/id1571699396).

## Next?

I also tested Flutter‚Äôs web app by building a working web version of my simple app, [ZIP Code PH](https://reddavid.me/zipcodeph-app/). It‚Äôs really really simple as of this moment.

I will be also going in-depth with Firebase and Firebase Auth to improve the mobile apps.

## Gaming and Streaming

Sadly, after coming back from the break, I felt no energy to play games - continue playing Assassin‚Äôs Creed: Odyssey or any other games on my Xbox PC game pass. And whenever I start a new game, I feel bored can‚Äôt motivate myself to continue playing.

I tried to play Dead Space, Battlefield 4, and VALORANT this November but also felt nothing.

But there is this game called 7 Days to Die on Steam that I am currently playing (not regularly, though) and I‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs worth playing through.

Catch me on [Facebook Gaming](https://www.facebook.com/RedDavidGG) when I go live, or on my [YouTube gaming channel](https://www.youtube.com/@reddavidgg) for uploads.
