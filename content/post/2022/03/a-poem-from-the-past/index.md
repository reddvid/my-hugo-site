Decluttering some files and found this little sad poem saved in a text file, and I just thought of sharing it.

<div id="poem">

<style>
div#poem {
   line-height: 0.8rem !important; text-align: center; background: rgba(125,130,130,0.1); width: 60%; margin: 0 auto; border-radius: 20px;
}

@media(max-width:768px){
   div#poem {width: 100%; }
}
   </style>

<h2 style="::before: none;border-inline-start: none; margin-left: 0;">My Heart Misses You</h2>

<br>

_My heart misses you_

_Like the drought misses a rainshower_

_Like a winter waiting for the summer_

_And like a dream I'd always remember_

<br>

_My heart misses you_

_Like the sun always there ready to shine_

_To wake up weary hearts sleeping fine_

_Like lovers looking for a valentine_

<br>

_My heart misses you_

_A warm feeling that embraces me_

_A happiness inside that you can set free_

_A love that you give unconditionally_

<br>

_My heart misses you_

_Every night i try to sleep_

_Every night I try not to weep_

_But this pain I feel's just too hard to keep_

<br>

_My heart misses you_

_That I cannot seem to live alone_

_after all this love you have shown_

_We could've worn that special stone_

<br>

_My heart misses you_

_As I speak every word I say_

_As I live my life through each day_

_I just miss you in every single way_

<br>

I remember writing this in my lola's (grandmother) house late in the evening, as the time, when I still very much miss my late ex-girlfriend after more than 3 months.

Now, I haven't visited her for the longest time and I really need to go visit sometime soon. And I hope she continues to watch me over every single time I live. :)

Go hug someone you love. Right now.
