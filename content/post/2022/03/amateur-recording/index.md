## Bye Condenser, Hello Dynamic

I let go of my [Audio Technica ATR2500X condenser microphone](https://reddavid.me/mobile-game-streaming/#hardware) since recording with it picks up a lot of background noise-making the guitar sound bad when reducing noise on post-edit.

The ATR2500X does record good sound when inside a treated and noise-free room. Here is a sample, though it’s not in a room and background noise is environmental:

## Samson Q9U

I replaced the AT mic with a Samson Q9U, a USB/XLR combo dynamic microphone which I can directly use on a PC without a USB interface (XLR connection). Despite the slightly higher price, having a dynamic mic to record in a noisy room is slightly tolerable.

The package includes USB Type-C to Type-A cable and a windscreen together with the mic itself.

### Features

- Dynamic capsule with humbucking coil and neodymium magnet
- Cardioid polar pattern
- XLR Analog Output
- USB-C Digital output with 24-bit/96kHz resolution
- 1/8" output zero-latency headphone monitoring
- Low Cut Filter
- Mid-presence Boost
- Mute button controls both USB and XLR outputs

### Quick Specs

- Frequency Response: 50Hz–20kHz
- Polar Pattern: Cardioid (unidirectional)
- Impedance: 250Ω
- Bit Depth/Sample Rate: 24-bit, up to 96 kHz
- Digital Output: USB-C

## Setup

### Hardware

I use a cheap boom arm to hold the mic and reduce table vibration noise. The mic is connected with a third-party Type-C to Type-A braided cable to the PC and shows as Samson Q9U on Windows. I left the wind foam to further reduce noise.

### Software

I use the donationware app [Voicemeeter](https://voicemeeter.com/) to control my input and output audio devices on Windows, and also use the “Cassette” recorder to select the devices to record.

I mainly use this as recording instead of Audacity to monitor each input.

## Editing

I edit my recorded audio using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). I mostly reduce unwanted noise without affecting the guitar tones too much. I also add a few effects like Reverb, and Delay. And sometimes, I do add tracks directly to record overlay guitar solos.

## Samples

I think these was the best solos/cover I recorded with the guitar (not my voice) with a few effects added on the solo part (in Dahan). Despite the noticeable noise in both recordings, I hope you liked them, and I will continue to improve.
