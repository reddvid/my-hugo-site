Despite the fact that we do not have spring season in the Philippines, it is just good to clean and/or organize (this time) our digital life.

Honestly, I am lazy af to clean things on a regular basis since I really suck at scheduling. This happens often when I get caught doing things that require a pretty good amount of focus (or am I just giving reasons for my laziness?)

## Bit of My Digital History

If you didn’t know, I started my computer life at the early age of 9/10? I just remember I was in grade 5, 1997-ish, when I fell in love with computers. But with the lack of internet, I only grew up into video games and not programming. I just picked up programming during college days when I was actually bought a laptop by my parents.

We tackled a bunch of languages even being an Electronics Engineering student, like C++, Turbo C, and Java. But I didn’t felt good about those languages until our thesis days where I got help with a friend, an IT student, using VB.Net. I slightly understood it better than the latter ones. It was also the start of programming in [C#.Net](<[http://C#.Net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)>) for my Windows Phone to make apps.

## Files

Being into the Windows environment, files did matter and I actually had free 15GB of SkyDrive (OneDrive now) where I put my files in. While working, I actually preferred to use my laptop since it got more power than what they provide.

Now with more than 8 years, my cloud is cluttered and having to use extensive apps, software, and services means there are alot more files scattered everywhere.

Now let’s go organizing.

## Organizing

### Personal Files

I suck at organizing back in the day that I actually did not create folders to group similar files.

Now I slowly group and organize files and folders properly. Starting with the Documents and Pictures folder. Although my Documents folder still sucks since Windows games create their own _saves_ folder which makes the list longer and hard to group.

In the Pictures folder, I began grouping photos and videos based on Year > Month, while other non-sense images went into an Archives folder or Others folder.

For my **_Personal_** folder, I grouped files by type and use:

<small>
|--Ebooks<br>
|--Archive<br>
|--Graphics<br>
|--Family<br>
|--Art<br>
|--Stream Assets<br>
</small>

Then the files go into further folders like inside Stream Assets:

<small>
|--Stream Assets<br>
&emsp;|--Game Wallpapers<br>
&emsp;|--Media<br>
&emsp;|--Stingers<br>
&emsp;|--Emotes<br>
</small>

### Work Files

This seems easier to organize by grouping files based on the responsibility/project, so I just went into choosing a better way to name work files. Continue reading below.

## File Naming

I started renaming work files since collaboration and sharing may require some context on the date and file versions:

### Documents (docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx, etc)

<code>YYYY-MM-DD_TYPE_File_Name_Version#.extension<br>
2022-03-29_REPORT_Some_Incident_With_The_Clock.docx</code>

### Graphics/Media Files (jpg, png, psd, mp3, mp4 etc)

I use the dash and underscore interchangeably but I am more inclined to use underscore for consistency:

<code>file_name_tags.extension or tags_file_name.extension or both<br>
ad_magic_stylus_square_720x720.png <br> open_graph_styled_frame_template.ai</code>

### Codes

Depending on the programming language, I strictly use their naming conventions/standard for clarity and consistency. But with other types like json, txt, and other asset files:

<code>file_name.extension<br>
products_list.json<br>
secret_codes.txt</code>

## Cloud

All these files now live in the cloud, OneDrive specifically, and reformatting or changing machine makes it easier to get the files again. Less hassle and worries especially when a big part of my life depends on some important files.

I am subscribed to Microsoft 365 Personal which offers 1TB of cloud storage and as of now I use around 48%.

[Sign up to OneDrive and get 500MB additional storage space.](https://onedrive.live.com?invref=fe92ac3ae0420178&invscr=90)

## Share Your Way

So that’s about my file naming and folder organization and it is still on-going as of this writing. How do you organize your digital life? Share it on the comments below.
