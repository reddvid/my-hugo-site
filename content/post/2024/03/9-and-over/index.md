**Cheers for the 9 years!**

I just quit my job of 9 years to shift careers. I wanted to pursue a career in programming (or deeper in IT). As writing this post, I am taking at least a month-long break to accomplish personal things.

Some of these things include:

+ Finally getting a license to drive
+ Updating my IDs from *single* to being *married*
+ Visit some places
+ And play some video games ðŸ˜„

I won't detail much about the reason, and process leaving my job, but it ended well (I think, hopefully, maybe). And I honestly look forward to their continuous success.

### Hit me up

Know anyone who can *risk* or take the chance hiring a 30+ year old guy doing .NET/C# Desktop/Mobile software development since 2013? Hit me up on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/reddvid/).

**GLHF!**

(Also sorry for not posting for such a long time!)
