On supported motherboards and having the Realtek Driver installed, the Realtek Audio Control should be pre-installed (on my case it has the MSI branding).

Just set the settings as seen from the screenshot below:

Now hopefully you can hear the same audio from two devices, otherwise check your device output settings.
