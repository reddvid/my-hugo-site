(This post will get updated from time to time adding new learning.)

Welp, in a decade of handling computers - hardware and software, I never really took any professional certifications of proving my tech skills. And this year hopefully, I can get into at least one.

First, I was never really surrounded by tech people, personally or in the workplace, so the *pressure* or *need* to have one never really occurred to me despite knowing their existence and importance.

Second, I already had an Engineer license and felt thatâ€™s enough.

Lastly, I canâ€™t afford the exams. ðŸ«£

This blog post will contain any *new* learning and other things I am yet to put my hands on (for a quick glance to help remembering).

* Thereâ€™s actually *numbered* steps in IT troubleshooting.
  * I am pretty much comfortable in troubleshooting and basically do the steps unknowingly.
* Bit/Bytes measurement follows the International System (SI). 1Kbps = 1,000 bps.
* A half byte is a nibble.
* Understood Multi-channel Memory.
* Newer motherboards still call it BIOS despite being UEFI.
* RAID disks (never got to practice this).
* Containerization.
* Further Cloud Computing.
* Thereâ€™s a word APIPA.
* VLAN-ing.
