I just updated my OBS a few days ago with the official release version after trying out the several release candidates.

I will talk about the new features and improvements here that will be useful for my use. Check their blog post [here](https://obsproject.com/blog/obs-studio-27-released) and the complete changelog [here](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/27.0.0).

## Undo & Redo

At last! No more annoyances when you just ACCIDENTALLY move something on the canvas. Undo and redo is here for every change you do in your sources and scenes - not sure for all filters though. And that’s 5000 actions.

Though I mostly use OBS for game streaming (no facecam), I move things around only to notice that it was not the source I wanted to move! This surely helps users out and always had been the most requested feature.

## Files, where?

Version 27 also added a missing files window prompt on launch that allows us to relocate or ignore the missing files. Nice addition so we don’t go start streaming only to have the files missing.

## No More Noise

OBS v27 for Windows now adds NVIDIA Noise Removal as an option to audio Noise Suppression filter <del>when the [NVIDIA Audio Effects SDK](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-sdk/resources/) is installed. Oh, also you need an NVIDIA RTX GPU for that - so no screenshots from me.</del>

## Improvements

Thanks for these 2 new improvements among others:

- Browser Source interact button (toolbar)
- Virtual Camera toggle button (system tray)

## Final Thoughts

This new version of OBS Studio definitely helps with the new added features. Now I want a selective record feature.

I use OBS Studio together with <a class="link" href="https://streamelements.com/" target="_blank">StreamElements</a> OBS Live to simplify my stream setup to Facebook Gaming. I now have 1,019 followers (as of this writing) and why not check me out there? Maybe talk about gaming, life, or programming? <a class="link" href="https://fb.gg/RedDavidGG/" target="_blank">RedDavidGG on Facebook Gaming</a>

I dedicate the starwall page for my stars-sender. Thanks and make sure to check out OBS Studio’s latest release <a class="link" href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">here.</a>
