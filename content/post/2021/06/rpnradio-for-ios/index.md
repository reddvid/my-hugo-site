After more than 3 months of processing Apple Developer Program's requirements, the app is here for iPhones!

This is the very same version we release for the Android counterpart [read the details on this blog post](https://reddavid.me/rpnradio-android/). Ads are disabled for now as I am still fixing things with the release of iOS 14.7
