## Me = Apple User?

Yes, I gave in to use an Apple device. Well, I've tried an iPhone XS before, and I must admit, having a device with software dedicated to its hardware is chef's kiss. That's what I liked about Apple, the hardware and software work along each other, and like most people, the price-tag for their phones held me back until December.

I _loaned_ for an iPhone 11 since the iPhone 12 is expensive and I like the 11's grip instead of the sharp edges of the new design. I got a yellow one since the black sold out. Then I realized black, though very simple, is such a generic color that it doesn't stand out as a phone's color and I've had too many black phones before.

## Developing Apps for iOS Soon

I'm excited to learn new things and finally applying the cross-platform capabilities of <a class="link" href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms">Xamarin.Forms</a> which I have used in some of my Android apps and it's <a class="link" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/">C#</a>. I also want to check out native code from Apple, <a class="link" href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a>.

Developing for Apple is quite costly, that you need to own a Mac (or rent online) and â‚±4450 ($99) for an individual to publish to the App Store. And it is YEARLY.

{{< figure src="/images/02-21/iphone-11/applibrary.jpg" width="50%" caption="iOS 14 App Library (is that TikTok? ðŸ˜…)" alt="iOS 14 App Library (is that TikTok? ðŸ˜…)" >}}

So, to test things out, I would be putting my app <a class="link" href="/zipcodeph-android-dark-mode/">ZIP Code PH</a> on the App Store and might set a (very very small) price to support this costly Apple environment ðŸ˜‚.

## In the meantime...

Go ahead and check out my apps on the <a class="link" href="ms-windows-store://publisher?name=Red David">Windows 10 Store</a> and <a class="link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5465762079490576029">Google Play Store</a> both under Red David.

See you soon!
