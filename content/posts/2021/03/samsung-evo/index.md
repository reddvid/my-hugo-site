Here we go again folks! Another PC upgrade, this time we take our storage to the next level.

# Top Player

I just bought a Samsung 970 EVO Plus, 1TB for my "coding needs". I recently experience a throttle while using my current XPG 500GB - I have been using some Virtual Machines lately to test out some things, and the SSD space gets loaded up quickly.

The SSD costs me around US$100 and failed to get a cheaper one since I am not paying the whole price - again, I got this for credit. ðŸ˜…

# Samsung, why?

Samsung has been the top brand for SSDs and I can say this myself since personally, I used an 860 EVO in the past for my laptop. And even though my current XPG SSD does it's job, I needed an storage upgrade and it's time to get this one.

The technical specs and comparison is available in the internet which you can visit on PCWorld, [Samsung 970 EVO Plus review](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3334876/samsung-970-evo-plus-review-samsungs-entry-level-nvme-ssd-is-faster-and-cheaper.html)

# Take a Look

I forgot to take pictures to avoid the SSD from picking up some static from my desk mat. But I did take a picture of the box before installing it on the system.

This is not to flaunt the things I have, I'm just trying to share my thoughts and share which can help my daily activities like coding, and file and graphics processing.
