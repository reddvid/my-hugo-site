Huh, who knew? That we can get through the sh*tty year that is 2020. 🤔 And for last time (and maybe first?), let's take a look back to what happened with Red David's life in last year (SPOILER: not so much, like most of us I guess).

## Puerto Galera, 2nd week of January

New Year, New Decade! We expected a lot in 2020 coming from 2019. It started out pretty much a normal month. We would have the time to travel out of town, 

It is always a good feeling when you can travel on the first month of the year, so that's what we did. So my girlfriend and I went to Puerto Galera, Mindoro and rented a place to stay for 3 days and 2 nights. 

This place has been a must-travel not just for us both but for most of Pinoys. The white sand beach makes this place present on everybody's bucket list.

Our stay was short but it was worth-while. From walking along the beach, taking "artistic" photos, watch the sunset enjoyed a quite weekday evening, and chilled during the weekend evening when the "bands" and music will fill up the place. We also had henna tattoos, got a massage, and just tried to taste all the food.

Here are some of the photos we took during our short stay:

## Taal Volcano Eruption

Ok hold on, this wasn't a part of our trip but as we are leaving the port to return to Metro Manila, we found out that Taal Volcano erupted (which was located in Batangas) but thankfully the eruption was slow that we weren't stranded along the way. But this news may be the start of something awful through 2020.

The volcano spewed a lot of volcanic ash that towns and cities, including Metro Manila. 

## Trip to BGC, last week of January

This should be the last week of January and the KPop group Winner was doing a tour in Manila. I am not a KPop fan but my sister is that the 3 girls in our family went to SM Mall of Asia to watch them.

The next day, we went to visit Baclaran church to give thanks to the Lord and went straight the infamous <a href="https://megaworld-lifestylemalls.com/mall/mckinley-hill/">Venice Grand Canal Mall</a> in Taguig, a Venice-inspired open-air mall.

After exhausting the whole place, we went down to Bonifacio High Grounds which is not that far from the canal mall. We just walked around the place, took some photos, and tried to visit a museum but unfortunately they were already closed.

## Valentine's Day, the usual February

Hmmm. There'actually s nothing special happened in this month but the usual Valentine's date on the 14th. We just went to this semi-high end restaurant and ordered some pizza, pasta and wine.
